Account plays role as a context.
It has 4 states : LoggedIn, LoggedOut, Blocked and initial EmptyState.
And it has 3 member functions to switch between states.
From Blocked state one cant switch to any state.
From Empty state one can switch to each state.
LoggedIn, LoggedOut allows to switch to LoggedOut, Blocked and LoggedIn, Blocked states respectively.

Classes Account and LoggedIn contains .cpp files in order to prevent cyclic references in the other files headers. 
That situation could arise because all definitions are located in .h files for simplicity.
