# my-patterns
This repo is dedicated to the most common programming patterns (in my point of view).

Repo consists of a few folders with pattern names.
Each folder contains several classes and a bacis example of their usage.
The classes inside one folder are united by the idea of a specific pattern.

All code has been written using C++, Visual Studio.
