Invoker is set "do" command and appropriate "undo" command.
When invoker calls execute, undo or redo methods it pushes executed command into history stack. 
Moreover when invoker calls execute and redo methods it also pushes command into undo stack.
Similarly invoker pushes command into redo stack when it calls undo method.

Addition, Deletion, Move commands implements IUndoRedoCommand interface.
Deletion is opposite (undo command) for Addition. 
Move doesnt have a direct opposite command because for reversing its action one needs to pass 
previous coordinates with the opposite sign.

IUndoRedoCommand does not contain undo method to implement in order to help history stack print appropriate
description of called command. It is worth noting, history stack contains pointers to IUndoRedoCommand and does not know
what method of IUndoRedoCommand was called.
