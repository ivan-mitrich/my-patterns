Waitress has to show Restaurant Menu that consists of Bar and Kitchen.
Both of them have different menu organization. 
Thats why waitress uses iterator to iterate through each menu.

BarIterator is a pointer which usage helps to avoid extra copying of its members.
This extra copying makes list iterator invalid, because it is initialized in constructor only once.
While after being copied list collection changes its location in memory.
